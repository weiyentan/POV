##Pester Operational Validation module

The POV module is a tool that I have created that is for operational validation testing using Pester.

At this stage (12/30/2016) the only function that is created is called Invoke-POVTest. This function allows you to pass any object properties to a Pester test. It accepts objects over the pipeline.
